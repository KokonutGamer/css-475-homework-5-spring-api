## CSS 475 Homework 5: Java Spring API

This project uses a few Spring libraries to create a web API based on a homework assignment specified in a course I'm taking (CSS 475 at the University of Washington Bothell, Winter 2025). These are as follows:
- Spring Web: the backbone to web applications developed in Spring
- Lombok: a library that reduces boilerplate for writing Plain Old Java Objects (POJOs)
- Spring Data JPA: a Spring specific Java Persistence API (JPA) wrapper
- PostgreSQL Driver: a driver library for connecting web applications to a PostgreSQL database
